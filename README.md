Esperanto Keyboard for the Colemak Layout on macOS


# Summary

There are a multitude of options to pick from if you want to type the Esperanto hat-characters (ĉapelitoj) using the QWERTY keyboard layout. However, there is nothing available to those who use any other alternative keyboard layouts - Colemak is no exception.

# Installation

To install, copy over the Colemak (Esperanto).bundle to ~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/, and add the keyboard layout (System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources)

# Usage

This keyboard layout uses the x-system for typing ĉapelitoj.

c + x = ĉ; C + x = Ĉ
g + x = ĝ; G + x = Ĝ
h + x = ĥ; H + x = Ĥ
j + x = ĵ; J + x = Ĵ
s + x = ŝ; S + x = Ŝ
u + x = ŭ; U + x = Ŭ

If you need to type cx, gx, hx, jx, sx, ux:

c + Tab/Esc + x = cx
g + Tab/Esc + x = gx
h + Tab/Esc + x = hx
j + Tab/Esc + x = jx
s + Tab/Esc + x = sx
u + Tab/Esc + x = ux 

# Development

This keyboard layout was made with [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele). If you wish to make any changes to the layout, I recommend that you also use it. Pull requests are welcome.

# Known issues

Some apps don't honor the above mentioned Tab/Esc method. The work around for that would be to type x first, move the cursor behind the x, type c/g/h/j/s/u, and then press the arrow key to the end of the word.
